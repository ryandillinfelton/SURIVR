This is a repository for the starter code of homework for [EE267 (Spring 2018, Stanford University)](https://stanford.edu/class/ee267/). We are going to release the starter code of each homework weekly here.

# Tutorial of Git and GitHub
If it is your first time to use Git, please go through one of the tutorials of Git to understand basic functionalities. If you know how to `clone`, `commit` and `pull`, you can skip it. The GitHub's official basic tutorial is available [here](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/).

# How to start homework (Homework 1)
You can either use CUI or GUI to clone this repository. However, *Please do not **Download ZIP** this repositoy!* If you prefer the GUI way, you can use [GitHub desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) to clone this repository.

If you prefer the CUI way, you can clone this repository to your local machine through your terminal by

Then, you are good to go! Enjoy the homework! The submission procedure is described in the homework document.

# How to get the following homework (Homework 2~)
